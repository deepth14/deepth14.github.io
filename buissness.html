        it sounds simple telling people to work hard and never quit,but to really
        excute and demonstrate those discipline and faith. Those are the two factors that 
        i belive seperats the good from the great: the succsess from the failures. Currentyl Abrham is studing masters in computer sciense
        at Maharishi International(MIU) in Iowa.
